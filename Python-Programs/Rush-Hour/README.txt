Running the program, and expected output:

Open the program, and start it
A prompt will then appear, asking for a maximal time. This will be 
the time that each algorithm has to solve a problem, before 
returning a failure.
Afterwards, the program will then commence solving each problem 1 by 1. It will present the initial board state
from rh.txt to the screen, and then output the solved board state for each algorithm, as well as key statistics
like depth, number of nodes traversed, and the solution length difference. If the algorithm is not able to solve 
the program in the maximal time, it will return a "FAIL" to the screen. 
The time taken and proposed solutions, or any potential failures will also be written to another file, known
as "output.txt" so that they can be opened later.

Recreation of the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game. 

It has extended upon the original Dino game in various ways, such as a different layout with smoother transitions between start screen and the game ending, as well as scaling of the game to the screen dimensions such that the game adapts to the window you play on. 
Three themes have also been added:
- Default (the basic game that plays similarly to the one offered by Google)
- Ocean (with two animated backgrounds and ocean themed obstacles)
- Space (with two animated backgrounds and space themed obstacles)
